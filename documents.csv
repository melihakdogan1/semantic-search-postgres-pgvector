"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals."
"Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals."
"Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving""."
"As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect."
"AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems."
"Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding, known as an ""AI winter""."
"AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, and imitating animal behavior."
"The field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields."
"Approaches to AI include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI."
"In the twenty-first century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful."
"The core problems of artificial intelligence include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects."
"General intelligence is still among the fieldâ€™s long-term goals."
"Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others."
"The AI effect is sometimes stated as ""AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."""
"Deep learning, big data, and advances in computing hardware have led to a resurgence of AI in the 21st century."
